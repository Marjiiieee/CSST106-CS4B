## **Computer Vision**

  At its core, **computer vision** is the ability of computers to understand and analyze visual content in the same way humans do. This includes tasks such as recognizing objects and faces, reading text and understanding the context of an image or video. 
Computer vision is closely related to artificial intelligence (AI) and often uses AI techniques such as machine learning to analyze and understand visual data. Machine learning algorithms are used to “train” a computer to recognize patterns and features in visual data, such as edges, shapes and colors. 
Once trained, the computer can use this knowledge to identify and classify objects in new images and videos. The accuracy of these classifications can be improved over time through further training and exposure to more data.
  The computer vision system consists of two main components: a sensory device, such as a camera, and an interpreting device, such as a computer. The sensory device captures visual data from the environment and the interpreting device processes this data to extract meaning.
Computer vision algorithms are based on the hypothesis that “our brains rely on patterns to decode individual objects.” Just as our brains process visual data by looking for patterns in the shapes, colors and textures of objects, computer vision algorithms process images by looking for patterns in the pixels that make up the image. These patterns can be used to identify and classify different objects in the image.
  To analyze an image, a computer vision algorithm first converts the image into a set of numerical data that can be processed by the computer. This is typically done by dividing the image into a grid of small units called pixels and representing each pixel with a set of numerical values that describe its color and brightness. These values can be used to create a digital representation of the image that can be analyzed by the computer.
  Image processing plays a critical role in AI, particularly in enhancing, manipulating, and analyzing visual data. This is crucial because visual data, like images and videos, often contains valuable information that needs to be extracted, processed, and interpreted for various applications.
